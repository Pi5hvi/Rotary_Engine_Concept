Hi,

The attachment contains a presenentation of all the data
on the rotary engine concept i talked to you about...

TO understand the working properly, first go through
the flash presentation i made...

The .swf or html file can be opened with a flash player
or any internet browser with flash installed on it...

Once the presentation starts though, theres no way of 
scrolling through it, so PAY ATTENTION!!! If you miss 
anything, you will have to restart the whole presentation
and wait for it to get to that point. You may puase and
play by right clicking (in windows, dunno abt mac)...

If you hav adobe Flash, you may directly open the .fla
file, that way, you can pause, scroll or edit the 
presentation...

Once you are done with the presentation go through the
sketches where you'll find a rough idea of the clamping
mechanism and coupling provided between the shaft and
wings and the body and wings of the engine

I'v sent the pro-e files which contain the component
designs and assembly of the engine as well, incase you
do manage to get pro-e from somewhere...

CHEERS!!
